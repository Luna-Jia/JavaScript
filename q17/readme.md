# ID & Passwords generator

This is a web page that makes id and password for a user. The inputs are last name, first name, and phone 
    number. The id is the first letter of the first name followed by the last name. The password is the last 
    letter of the first name followed by the first three letters of the last name followed by the last four 
    digits of the phone number. Both id and password are all upper case. For example if the first name is John, 
    last name is Maxwell, and phone number is 248-320- 5195 then the id is JMAXWELL and the password is NMAX5195. 
    There are three text boxes for the inputs. The boxes have place holders instead of labels. Limit the number 
    of characters in each name to 10. There is a button below the boxes to calculate the id and password. The id 
    and password are displayed below the button. The three inputs are checked for errors when the button is 
    clicked. The last and first names are strings of lower or upper case letters of length at least two. The 
    phone number format is xxx-xxx-xxxx. If an input has an error, an error message is shown on the right in red 
    color. The error message includes the correct input format. The error message does not appear if there is no 
    error. If there is an error then the id and password are not displayed. The page has an appropriate title. 
    Everything is centered on the page. Use appropriate css style.
